# 🎓 Placement Prediction App

This project predicts whether a student will be **Placed** or **Not Placed** using Machine Learning models.  
It is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**, where users can input student details and get instant placement predictions.

## 📌 Features
- Predicts **Placement Status** (`Placed` / `Not Placed`)  
- Clean and user-friendly **Streamlit UI**  
- Encodes and scales inputs automatically  
- Multiple ML models trained and compared for best performance  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Streamlit  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Joblib  

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

## 🚀 How It Works
1. User enters student details such as CGPA, Projects, Aptitude Test Score*, and soft skills Rating.  
2. The data is preprocessed and encoded.  
3. The trained model predicts whether the student is likely to be **Placed** or **Not Placed**.  
4. The result is displayed instantly with confidence.

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Add student profile analysis dashboards  
- Show feature importance visually (e.g., via SHAP values)  
- Connect with college databases for real-time predictions
